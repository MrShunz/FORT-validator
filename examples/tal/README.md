Please ignore this folder. It only exists in the hopes that `fort_setup.sh` continues working until it's retired. The script is deprecated at the moment.

The TALs contained here are pretty much all old and obsolete. If you need to download the current TALs, run `fort --init-tals --tal <TAL directory>` instead.
